#### ⚡ A bit about me
I love balancing **exercise**, **creativity**, and **continuous learning**. When I'm not shipping features, you can find me:
*   🏋️‍♂️ At the gym or running to keep the balance.
*   📚 Reading and exploring new technologies.
*   💡 Working on entrepreneurial ideas and designing useful products.
*   🤝 Connecting with people to share experiences and ideas.
